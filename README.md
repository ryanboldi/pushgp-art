# PushGP Art

Using the Push Genetic Programming system to evolve Compositional Pattern Producing Networks.

[PushGP](https://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/push.html) is a genetic programming system that evolves push programs. The implementation used in this project can be found [here](https://github.com/lspector/propeller).

Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), first proposed in [this paper](http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/stanley_aaaifs06.pdf), are a form of indirect encodings for genotype to phenotype mapping. 

Due to these networks' fundamental functional basis, implementing them in Clojure using the PushGP evolutionary framework seems to be an obvious direction to move in.

'Push' is a programming language that was specifically designed for use in evolutionary computation. For a quick introduction, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGJWlSC0gl4&t=13s) youtube video is a great resource.

In short, a Push program is a series of instructions that are carried out on a set of **stacks**. Each datatype (int, float, char, bool, etc) exists on its own stack. For the purposes of this project, only the float datatype stack was used. Along with datatypes, instructions also exist on their own stack. This allows for instruction duplication, if statements, and more complex computational paradigms.

The push implementation that was used in this project was written in Clojure, a Lisp dialect and can be found here: https://github.com/lspector/propeller.

### What?
----
For this project's use case, a CPPN can be thought of as a function of two variables:

CPPN(x, y) = output

Where (x,y) represents the coordinates of a single pixel in the outputted image, and the output is a pixel greyscale value from 0 to 1 to color this pixel with.

### How?
---

The genotype of these CPPNs are stored as **plushy** (linear push) programs. The push interpretter converts these plushies into a set of functional push programs, each representing a CPPN. This CPPN is then run w*w times (once for each pixel in a w x w pixel image), and the output is displayed. Below is an example of 16 completely random 128x128 images produced by 16 different CPPNs from push programs:

### Why?
----

This **indirect encoding** (called so due to the non-one-to-one mapping between genotype and phenotype), allows for a significant amount of compression of information. This compression is important when considering artificial life and how evolution took place in our own history. Things like bilateral symmetry, repeating patterns, or repetition with slight variation, are all due to certain genes being reused in special ways throughout our phenotype. This might explain how the ~30,000 genes in the human body are able to encode the 86+ billion neurons in the human brain (let alone the rest of the body's functions).

This means that we are able to use a relatively small CPPNs (100 or so push instructions) to encode images with more than 1,048,576 pixels (1024x1024).

There is, in fact, no theoretical maximum resolution for the output of the CPPN. The only limiting factor is that the higher the resolution, the more times the CPPN must be run to generate the output. The interesting thing is that a trained CPPN will output the same image to higher resolutions __without any further evolution__. This is why images should be evolved in lower resolution (64x64 or 128x128), and then can be displayed at higher resolutions once a good solution is found.

For example, the 3rd outputted image in the previous section looks interesting. Here is the plushy that produced it: 
```
 (:float_add :float_subtract :exec_dup :float_gt :float_gt :float_cos :exec_dup :float_lt :float_cos :float_max :float_gauss 1 :float_mod1 close :float_sin :float_quot :exec_if :in2 :float_add close :float_lt :in1 :float_mult :float_subtract :in1 :in2 :float_lt :in1 :float_subtract :exec_dup :in2 :float_mod1 :exec_if :in1 0 :float_gt close :float_max :float_lt :exec_dup :float_mult :exec_dup :float_sin :float_quot 0 :float_min :exec_if :float_tan :float_mod1 :float_mod1 :in1 :float_gauss :float_min :float_quot :float_mod1 :float_sin :float_quot :float_min :float_gauss close :float_mod1 :float_gt 1 :float_subtract 0 0 0 1 :float_add :float_subtract :float_mult :float_subtract :float_quot :float_gauss :exec_dup :float_tan :float_mod1 :float_subtract :exec_dup :float_tan :float_subtract :float_sin close :float_quot close :float_min :in2 :float_add :float_mod1 :float_mod1)

Here it is at 10x10 resolution:
